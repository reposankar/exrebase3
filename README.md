# Rebase Demo 4

  ## Introduction:

  This repo is maintained to demonstrate rebase functionality of git.

  ### feature branch rebase:

Most code integrations happen with a merge, but occasionally a developer wants to get their local code caught up with the master branch through a rebase instead. In this example we will demonstrate how to git rebase a branch to master instead of using the merge command, while also pointing out the impact of performing a git rebase to master operation.

In this tutorial, we will take the branch named develop and rebase it onto the tip of master.

The develop branch broke off from master at commit C, so both branches share the files a.html, b.html and c.html. See the image below to help visualize this.
