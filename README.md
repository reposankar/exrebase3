# Rebase Demo 4

  ## Introduction:

  This repo is maintained to demonstrate rebase functionality of git.

  ### feature branch rebase:

	Most code integrations happen with a merge, but occasionally a developer wants to get their local code caught up with the master branch through a rebase instead. In this example we will demonstrate how to git rebase a branch to master instead of using the merge command, while also pointing out the impact of performing a git rebase to master operation.
